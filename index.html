          <p>Yip!Yeah! came together out of a necessity to shake things up.
            Each of the trio having come from his own dynamic background and
            musical influences, they fused their diverse talents to create a
            unique genre-bending sound paired with sights unseen.  With a core
            dedication to living life out of the box Yip!Yeah! will keep you
            equally guessing and wanting more.
          </p>
	        <p>Comprised of Grant Cunningham(drums), Nathan Talley(bass), and
            Austin Slominski(Visuals/Midi-instrumentalist) Yip!Yeah! takes advantage
            of the technology around them in todayâ€™s world.  Their performance
            is designed to be both a musical journey and a visual experience,
            with instrumental music set to a psychedelic backdrop of digital projections.
